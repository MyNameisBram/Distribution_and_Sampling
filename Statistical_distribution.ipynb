    "# Statistical Distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "According to [MathWorld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/StatisticalDistribution.html), *The distribution of a variable is a description of the relative numbers of times each possible outcome will occur in a number of trials.* Let me help and try to break this down. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are the some of the most common distributions: \n",
    "1. Uniform Distribution \n",
    "2. Binomial Distribution \n",
    "3. Normal Distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "These statistical distributions informs us about the distribution of probability of an event happening given a set of parameters. Distributions can either be **Continuous** or **Discrete**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuos Distribution:\n",
    "We're measuring an event with any real number. Example, height. A person can be 5'9\" or 5'10\", and it can also be any number in between those. We can measure up to a level of precision of our choosing. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete Distribution: \n",
    "These events are often called *Bernoulli Trials*, where the outcome is binary and fractions/decimals are not allowed. A good example of this is a coin flip. The coin can either land on heads or it doesn't. \n",
